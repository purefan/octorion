These are rather simple snippets of code, mostly in C++ that illustrate small tasks. 
There are many ways of doing things in every programming language, if you have a better way that's good for you,
the examples I provide here are meant to help and have been tested to work so they are at least acceptable, feel
free to fork me and take the glory of your improved version. I will glady pull any version that improves on the
documentation.

All the C++ examples have been compiled using CodeBlocks 10 on Windows 7 (http://www.codeblocks.org/)
